# Module 6 
By Michael Pogue on 21Feb23

## Task 1. Open Your Existing Project
1. On your machine, open your existing streaming-05-getting-started repo in VS Code. :heavy_check_mark:
2. Create a file for your consumer (or 3 files if you'd like to use 3 consumers). :heavy_check_mark:

## Task 2. Design and Implement Each Consumer
    Design and implement each bbq consumer. You could have one. You could have 3.  More detailed help provided in links below. 
    Use the logic, approach, and structure from prior modules (use the recommended versions).
    Modifying them to serve your purpose IS part of the assignment.
    Do not start from scratch - do not search for code - do not use a notebook.
    Use comments in the code and repo to explain your work. 
    Use docstring comments and add your name and date to your README and your code files. 

## Task 3. Professionally Present your Project
    Explain your project in the README.
    Include your name, date.
    Include prerequisites and how to run your code. 
    Explain and show how your project works. 
    Tell us what commands are needed. Use code fencing in GitHub or backtics for inline code to share commands.
    Display screenshots of your console with the producer and consumer running.
    Display screenshots of at least one interesting part of the RabbitMQ console. 

## Requirements
In your callback function, make sure you generate alerts - there will be a smoker alert and both Food A and Food B will stall. 

Your README.md screenshots must show 4 concurrent processes:
1. Producer (getting the temperature readings)
2. Smoker monitor
3. Food A monitor
4. Food B monitor

In addition, you must show at least 3 significant events.

Run each terminal long enough that you can show the significant events in your screenshots:
    Visible Smoker Alert with timestamp
    Visible Food A stall with timestamp
    Visible Food B stall with timestamp
